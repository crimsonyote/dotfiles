### NOTE: Please install the icons to /usr/share/icons. Otherwise some symlinks may break, causing icons to be displayed incorrectly. Also, make sure to install "Colloid-light" and "Colloid-dark" as the other colour variants use these to link to as a space-saving measure.

**You may run Dolphin as root to do this with the following command in your terminal:**

`pkexec env DISPLAY=$DISPLAY XAUTHORITY=$XAUTHORITY KDE_SESSION_VERSION=5 KDE_FULL_SESSION=true dolphin /usr/share/icons`

The Colloid icon theme was originally created by vinceliuice, so credit to them for the original icons.

### NOTE 2: The latte-dock layout was originally designed for use on a 1920x1080 display with 125% scaling. You may need to change its absolute size to 30px for use on larger displays.
